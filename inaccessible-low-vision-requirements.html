        Correct! If you managed to guess despite the useless alt text, do this

        accurate alt text can make.
        <p>
          N.B: The "<span class="code">title</span>" attribute is used above
          purely to quickly visually display the content of the alt text. Never
          solely rely on the title attribute to provide information, as it is
          inaccessible to keyboard-only and touch-only users.
        </p>
        <div class="h4Inaccessible">More information about alt text</div>
        <p>All non-text content should also be available in text.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Providing alternative text for an image doesn't always mean
            providing an explicit description of the image, but the
            meaning/context of the image should always be transcribed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Alt text doesn't need to include the word "picture" or "image"
            because the screenreader will announce "graphic" as standard.
          </li>
          <li>
            If working with diagrams or charts:
            <ul>
              <li>Add "diagram" or "chart" to the alt text.</li>
              <li>
                Very explicitly state what's shown in the diagram in enough
                detail that someone who can't see the image still gets all the
                same information.
              </li>
              <li>
                If there's text elsewhere which entirely fulfils the criteria of
                alt text for an image or chart, use the "<span class="code"
                  >aria-labelledby</span
                >" attribute and provide the <span class="code">id</span> of
                this text.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            If an image depicts a named item where the name doesn't directly
            relate to the image, provide both the given name and an explicit
            description.
            <ul>
              <li>
                For example, if the image is of a pink item of clothing but the
                name of that colour option is "Wish", then the alt text should
                include both a description of the clothing item (e.g. "A
                short-sleeved pastel pink tshirt with a white polka-dot
                pattern") and the word (e.g. "Colour variant name is 'Wish'.").
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Never use an image of text for anything except e.g. logos, and
            provide alt text in the case of the latter. Notice how the "Make me
            accessible" link above is actually an image of text with no alt text
            or keyboard focus option - someone using a screenreader would be
            completely unable to observe or use this link.
          </li>
          <li>
            Never include any meaningful image using the CSS
            <span class="code">background-image</span>
            property, as screenreaders will skip it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Exceptions to the need for alt text:
            <ul>
              <li>
                When the experience added to the content is purely sensory, e.g.
                video of someone drawing, but there should still be some kind of
                identifying label (e.g. "speed drawing of Edinburgh Castle").
              </li>
              <li>
                CaptCHAs - bots can read alt text, thus defeating the purpose of
                the CaptCHA, but there should be alternative CaptCHAs designed
                for people with disabilities, and/or a phone number to call for
                support.
              </li>
              <li>
                When an image is for decoration only and is otherwise
                meaningless - in this case the "<span class="code">noAlt</span>"
                attribute should be added.
              </li>
              <li>
                Input forms as a whole due to their interactivity. Each
                individual input should still have an appropriate label.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Never, ever, use the alt text attribute for lists of words related
            to page topics for "search engine optimisation", as is sometimes
            ignorantly suggested.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Any time-based visual content (e.g. instruction videos) should be
          accompanied by a text alternative describing the visual content and/or
          by an audio description.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="h3Inaccessible">Sensory characteristics of UI</div>
      <p>
        Don't create interfaces that only rely on sensory characteristics in
        order to be operable. These characteristics could be colour, shape, or
        location on the page. Screenreaders do not indicate what shape or colour
        a button is, nor whether it's on the left or right of a page. Even a
        sighted user with colourblindness can be disadvantaged by only using
        colour to differentiate components.

        <p>
          To someone using a screenreader or someone with red-green
          colourblindness, it's impossible to tell which of the two buttons
          above is correct without trying them both - imagine the problems if
          one cancelled an order and the other submitted an order. If we had
          said "select the red circle on the right", this would have helped a
          colourblind user but not one using a screenreader.
        </p>
        <p>
          This requirement doesn't mean that colour can't be used to
          differentiate elements, only that it can't solely be responsible for
          this. Labelling elements is an excellent way to fulfil this criterion.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="h3Inaccessible">Colour contrast</div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          There should always be a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 between
          text/foreground colour and the background colour, except for in the
          following cases:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Large-scale text of at least 18pt or 14pt bold font size, in which
              case the ratio should be at least 3:1.
            </li>
            <li>
              Text that's part of an inactive UI component (disabled), is purely
              decorative, isn't visible to anyone, or are part of a picture
              containing significant other visual content.
            </li>
            <li>Text that's part of a logo or brand name.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          To conform to the "Enhanced" contrast criterion (Level AAA), the ratio
          between text and background should be >=7:1, except for large-scale
          text which should have a ratio of at least 4.5:1.
          <ul>
            <li>
              A common default text base colour is
              <span class="code">#666666</span> (or
              <span class="code">rgb(102, 102, 102)</span>), which fails this
              criterion against a white background, but
              <span class="code">#575757</span> passes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="basicTextColour"
                >This text has the
                <span class="code">#666666</span> colour. </span
              ><span
                >This text has the <span class="code">#575757</span> colour, as
                does the rest of the basic text on this website.</span
              >
            </li>
            <li>
              The aesthetic doesn't appear to be negatively affected by this
              change, but this small change would make the difference between
              making the page fully accessible in this aspect or not.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Note the difference in how easy it is to read text with high contrast
        against the background compared with low contrast against the
        background.

      <ul>
        <li>
          Content can be presented without loss of information or functionality,
          and without requiring scrolling in two dimensions for:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Vertical scrolling content at a width greater than or equivalent
              to 320 CSS pixels (e.g. a viewport width of 1280px wide at 400%
              zoom).
            </li>
            <li>
              Horizontal scrolling at a height greater than or equivalent to 256
              CSS pixels (e.g. a viewport height of 1024px at 400% zoom).
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Note how the functionality of the navigation bar on this page is lost
          at narrower screen widths, with options being pushed offscreen.
        </li>
        <li>
          An exception to this requirement is for parts of content which require
          a 2D layout for usage or meaning. For example, if a table component
          has horizontal and vertical scrolling when the viewport is greater
          than the dimensions above, this is acceptable as long as only the
          table component has these scrollbars and not the whole page.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="h3Inaccessible">Focus indicator</div>
      <p>
        Don't rely on the default browser focus indicator, as in many cases this
        violates accessibility criteria.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          When a UI component displays visible keyboard focus, all of the
          following should be true:
          <ul>
            <li>
              The focus indication area should be at least as large as the
              longest side of the bounding rectangle of the focussed control.
              i.e. The focus ring should be around the whole element.
            </li>
            <li>
              The colour changes used to indicate focus should have at least a
              3:1 contrast ratio with the colours changed from the unfocussed
              control.
            </li>
            <li>
              The focus indication area either has a thickness of at least 2 CSS
              pixels, or has a 3:1 contrast ratio against all adjacent colours.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The focus ring should always be solid, not dotted or dashed.</li>
        <li>
          The ring should be around the whole element, but this doesn't mean it
          needs to conform to the shape of the element - for example, a
          star-shaped element doesn't need a star-shaped focus ring.
        </li>
