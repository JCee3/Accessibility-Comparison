        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This page will take you through some activities for each section of the website. These activities are
            designed to help you
            understand how it feels to need certain accessibility requirements that haven't been met. You may wish
            to keep this page open in a separate window for easy reference. You will need to use the Google Chrome web
            browser for certain activities.</p>
        <p>Each section of this website has an "accessible" and an "inaccessible" version, and this page is no
            exception. However, there are no activities relating specifically to this page as it introduces no new
            functionality.</p>

                <h3>Keyboard-only Navigation</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Try navigating through the <a href="inaccessible-index.html">inaccessible homepage</a> using
                        only
                        your
                        Tab and
                        Arrow keys.
                    </li>
                    <li>Note how none of the
                        options on the navigation bar are highlighted, and nor is the "Make me accessible" "link". This
                        is
                        because they're not buttons, but rather &lt;span&gt; elements with "onclick", which are not
                        natively
                        added to
                        the tab
                        order like buttons are. The "make me accessible" is actually an image of text, which has the
                        same
                        problem as spans with the added issue of the text being impossible for a screenreader to parse.
                    </li>
                    <li>More information on these issues can be found in the Vision and Dexterity sections.</li>
                    <li>It's much easier to navigate through the <a href="index.html">accessible homepage</a> using Tab
                        and
                        Arrow keys, because semantic
                        elements are being used which allow keyboard navigation by default.

                <ol>
                    <li>On the <a href="inaccessible-low-vision-requirements.html">"Inaccessible Vision"</a> page, read
                        the
                        "Alt
                        text and descriptions of video content" section and follow the instruction in it. Notice how the
                        content
                        of the alt text actively makes the activity more difficult, as the entire contents will be read
                        to a
                        screenreader user.
                    </li>

                        which
                        should be much easier.

                <ol>
                    <li>First, download the <a
                            href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/colorblindly/floniaahmccleoclneebhhmnjgdfijgg"

                        has a troubleshooting section.
                    </li>
                    <li>Open the <a href="inaccessible-low-vision-requirements.html">"Inaccessible Vision"</a> page and
                        set
                        the
                        Colorblindly
                        extension to use the "Green-Blind/Deuteranopia" setting.
                    </li>
                    <li>Read the "Sensory characteristics of UI" section and follow the instruction in it.</li>
                    <li>Repeat this for the <a href="low-vision-requirements.html">"Accessible Vision"</a> page. Note
                        how
                        even
                        though the colours are still just as difficult
                        to distinguish between, it is much easier to complete the task.
                    </li>
                    <li>You may wish to turn off Colorblindly for subsequent Vision activities.</li>

            <section id="vision_responsive_design_activity">
                <h3>Activity 3 - Responsive Design</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>This activity can be done on any section of the website, but is most relevant to Vision which
                        has information on this requirement.
                    </li>
                    <li>Go to an inaccessible page (e.g. <a href="inaccessible-low-vision-requirements.html">"Inaccessible
                        Vision"</a>) and inspect it using Chrome's Developer Tools (right-click > Inspect).
                    </li>
                    <li>Toggle the Device Toolbar, set Dimensions to "Responsive", and set the width of the viewport to
                        320.
                    </li>
                    <li>320 CSS pixels is the minimum width at which all content must be accessible without horizontal
                        scrolling. This benefits users who require a very high zoom level to access content, as well as
                        conforming to standard responsive design for mobile devices.
                    </li>
                    <li>Note that much of the navigation bar becomes unreachable, extending out past the edge of the
                        viewport.
                    </li>
                    <li>Repeat this task on an accessible page (e.g. <a href="low-vision-requirements.html">"Accessible
                        Vision"</a>).
                    </li>
                    <li>See that the presentation of the navbar changes. It is now a vertical stack unhidden
                        and hidden by a single button. No content or functionality is lost, despite the much narrower
                        screen.
                    </li>
                    <li>Note also that at "desktop" dimensions the video on the <a
                            href="inaccessible-hard-of-hearing-deaf-requirements.html">"Inaccessible
                        Hearing"</a> page expands to fill the whole screen because no max-width was set for larger
                        viewports. Filling the screen by default is not desired behaviour in this case, and there is
                        already a button
                        for fullscreen video.

                        page, watch the video. Consider how difficult it is to determine
                        what's being said - is Jessica saying she's faking deafness?
                    </li>

                        page, and watch the video. Notice how you now know exactly what's being said, and how an
                        impression completely opposite to the truth was given in the non-captioned video.

                    </li>
                    <li>Notice how many
                        interactive sections there are, that they may be things the user absolutely does not want to
                        interact with, and how long it takes to get to the desired location. Consider how your
                        experience would be impacted if this was the case for every webpage you visited.

                        and which will disappear when it does not receive focus.
                    </li>
                    <li>Press the Enter key and see that the header/navigation bar has been skipped and the unique page
