            Jessica Kellgren-Fozard: I wanted to start my Deaf video week with
            13 things I want my hearing friends to know. <br />
            #1: I'm faking it. <br />
            Yeah, my understanding that is. <br />
            Because really, I have no clue! <br />
            Probably 50% of the time, I've just- I've lost the plot. <br />
            I'm good at it. It's second nature now, but I hate it. <br />
            I'll have a conversation with you. We will walk away from each
            other. <br />
            You'll think, "Oh yeah, completely. She completely knows what's
            going on." <br />
            No, no. <br />
            For the last 10 minutes, maybe, I've had absolutely no clue.
            <br />
            It is amazing how far "oh, yes" and "really?" and this face <br />
            Can get you in life.

          <p>
            Captions are extremely important for anyone who may have
            difficulties understanding spoken language or sounds. This is not
            just people who are hard of hearing or D/deaf, but also people
            struggling to pay attention due to neurodivergence or situation, and
            those accessing the content in locations where the sound
            cannot/should not be heard.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Open" captions are "baked-in" to the video content, and thus cannot
            be disabled or enabled. This also means their content can't be
            accessed by other means, such as a refreshable Braille display which
            may be used by people with both visual and hearing disabilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Closed" captions (CC) can be enabled/disabled, but should be
            enabled by default. Not every platform will allow the use of CC, but
            it should be preferred whenever possible. The HTML
            <span class="code">&lt;video&gt;</span> element has a track
            attribute, which can be used to provide a
            <span class="code">.vtt</span> file with the associated captions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Transcripts are the complete written record of the sound content of
            a piece of media. The speakers should be identified, as well as
            relevant sound effects, and transcripts should be available
            independent of progress through media playback.
          </p>
          <p>
            Auto-generated captions can save time, but are rarely accurate.
            Human live captioners and human-created/reviewed transcripts are
            preferable, and vital if any media content being misunderstood could
            have significant negative impact.

      <h3>Sign language</h3>
      <p>
        Spoken language is not always the first language of D/deaf people, and,
        due to grammatical structures of signed languages and spoken languages
        differing, captions are not necessarily the most accessible way for
        these users to access content. Providing signed interpreting is a Level
        AAA WCAG success criterion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jessica in the video above is using Sign Supported English (SSE) rather
        than BSL. This uses the signs of BSL but with the grammatical structure
        of English. This is often used by people who have become deaf later in
        life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additonally, while certain signs may overlap, signed languages used in
        countries that share a spoken language can be vastly different. American
        Sign Language (ASL) and British Sign Language (BSL), for example, differ
        hugely, with the former having far more in common with French Sign
        Language (LSF).
      </p>
      <h2>A note on language</h2>
      <p>
        People who are culturally Deaf (e.g. raised in a Deaf family) refer to
        themselves as "Deaf" with an uppercase "D". A person can be deaf but not
        Deaf, hence the usage of "D/deaf" here. Further explanation on this can
        be found at
