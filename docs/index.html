        <p>
          In February 2024, only 4.1% of the top million web home pages were
          digitally accessible, based on automated accessibility checking.
        </p>
        <p class="bold">
          This checking only covers 25-30% of accessibility requirements.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/"
            >Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.2)</a
          >
          provide extensive and valuable guidance on the requirements to make
          the web accessible. There are three levels of compliance (A, AA, and
          AAA), with Level A being the absolute minimum required. This page aims
          to inform readers from a developer perspective of the basics needed to
          make their pages accessible to users with a wide range of disabilities
          and access requirements. Additionally, it is intended to help users
          understand a little of how it feels to have accessibility requirements
          that aren't met.
        </p>
        <p>Please see the Instructions section for activities to carry out.</p>
        <p>
          Below are some requirements that apply to multiple disabilities, or
          which do not fit into the categories above - more specific
          requirements are described in the pages for each disability.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="requirementsInfo">
        <h2>General Requirements</h2>
        <h3>Information and Relationships, Meaningful Sequence</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Use semantic elements - heading (<span class="code">&lt;h&gt;</span
            >) tags, <span class="code">nav</span>s for navigation, link (<span
              class="code"
              >&lt;a&gt;</span
            >) and <span class="code">button</span> elements rather than
            <span class="code">divs</span> or
            <span class="code">spans</span> with
            <span class="code">onClick()</span>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Never use the CSS <span class="code">content</span> property to
            provide meaningful text - this will not be included in the DOM and
            is thus inaccessible to anyone using tools that rely on the DOM.
          </li>
          <li>
            Content should have a logical order, and the focus order should
            follow the reading order.
            <ul>
              <li>
                For example, in a navigation bar, as above, tabbing through
                should focus on "Homepage", "Vision", "Hearing", "Dexterity",
                "FAQs" and "Instructions", in that order. Jumping around (e.g.
                starting with "Dexterity") can confuse users and make the page
                harder to use.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Content should behave in the way it's shown - if something looks
            like a hyperlink it should change the page the user is on, not do
            something on the page like a button.
            <ul>
              <li>
                It's acceptable to remove link underlines in situations such as
                navbars, as long as it's made clear that they're interactive.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            It should be obvious to the user where they are in the website. Note
            how the current page is bolded and underlined in the navbar above.
            Another example of this is the use of breadcrumb components for
            visibility of the sequence followed to navigate to a page,
            particularly useful in ecommerce with nested products and
            categories.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Seizures and physical reactions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Flashing lights can cause physical reactions in people with certain
            health issues, whether those are seizures, migraines, or another
            response.
          </li>
          <li>
            The minimum requirement to prevent these reactions is that nothing
            on the page should flash more than three times in one second, or the
            flash should be
            <a
              href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/three-flashes-or-below-threshold.html"
              >below general flash and red flash thresholds</a
            >. The latter of these can be quite complex to assess and may
            require the use of
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G15"
              >a tool</a
            >.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a video on the page breaches this, provide a seizure warning, as
            well as a
            <a href="low-vision-requirements.html"
              >text alternative to the video content</a
            >.
          </li>
          <li>
            This website does not showcase failure to meet this requirement due
            to the safety concerns that would cause.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Parsing</h3>
        <p>In content implemented with markup languages, elements:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Should have complete start and end tags.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Modern browsers have repair techniques, which allow them to
                parse broken HTML, but assistive technologies like screenreaders
                may not.
              </li>
              <li>
                An incomplete heading element's text may be accessed by a
                screenreader, but not be added to the list of headings.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Are nested according to their specifications.</li>
          <li>Don't contain duplicate attributes.</li>
          <li>
            With the <span class="code">id</span> attribute have unique IDs.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Not using unique IDs means that screenreaders cannot accurately
                access any instance of an element with that ID other than the
                first.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
