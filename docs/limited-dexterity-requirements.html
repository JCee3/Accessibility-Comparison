    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>
        People may have limited dexterity for many different reasons, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Paralysis from brain, spinal or nerve injury, including from such
            causes as stroke or quadriplegia.
        </li>
        <li>
            Amputation or congenital difference meaning the user does not have ten fingers, two hands/arms, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
            Poor control of hands or fingers due to tremors, weakness or
            spasticity, which could be caused by conditions such as cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy,
            or multiple sclerosis.
        </li>
        <li>
            Extreme fatigue, whether caused by illness (e.g. M.E., heart disease)
            or not.
        </li>
        <li>
            Temporary disability, such as from a broken limb or repetitive strain
            injury.
        </li>
        <li>
            Situation, such as needing to hold something with one hand/arm (e.g. a
            child, food) and only being able to freely use the other.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        While some users may control their devices with their voice, not every
        user in this category will. It's especially important to consider
        keyboard-only users.
    </p>
    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <!-- No drag and drop -->
    <!-- No keyboard traps - modal? -->
    <!-- Custom shortcuts? -->
    <!-- Skip to content -->
    <!-- Things moving around on the page so what you try to interact with moves and you either miss it or interact with something else. Esp bad for people with tremors. -->
    <h3>Keyboard use</h3>
    <h4>Operable only with keyboard</h4>
    <p>Try to access the following button using only the keyboard (Tab, arrow, and Enter keys):</p>
    <div class="buttonContainer">
        <button class="accessibleRectangularBlueButton" id="accessibleKeyboardOnlyOpenButton"
                onclick="toggleDivVisibility('hidableKeyboardOnlyInfo')">
            See Keyboard-Only Info
        </button>
    </div>
    <div id="hidableKeyboardOnlyInfo">
        <ul>
            <li>
                All content functionality should be operable through a keyboard
                interface, without requiring specific timing for individual
                keystrokes.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The only exception to this is when the underlying function
                        requires input that depends on the path of the user's movement and
                        not just the endpoints.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Please be aware of the difference between function and input
                        technique. If handwriting is being used to enter text, the input
                        technique requires path-dependent input, but the underlying
                        function of inputting text does not. In this case, the user should
                        be able to choose to enter text through the keyboard, not just a
                        touchscreen or other pad.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If drag-and-drop/swiping is an important input mechanic for the
                        page, an alternative must be available and obvious. Often a button
                        is the most suitable substitute.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                This is one of many occasions where using appropriate semantic
                elements will make it easier to create accessible sites, as using the
                correct element for the situation means elements that should be
                focussable generally will be. If an element needs to become
                focussable, adding <span class="code">tabindex=0</span> will at least place it inside the tab
                order.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h4>Keyboard traps</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Be aware of keyboard navigation when constructing forms. Radio button
            groups should be grouped using <span class="code">fieldset</span>, and individual entries should
            be focussable using arrow buttons, with tab taking the user out of the
            fieldset to the next group.
        </li>
        <li>
            Additionally, be very conscious of any use of the <span class="code">autofocus</span> attribute
            for an input field - it can be extremely confusing for users to start
            in what could be the middle of the page.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <form id="accessibleDexForm">
        <label for="firstName">Enter your first name: </label>
        <input type="text" id="firstName"/><br/>
        <fieldset>
            <legend>How familiar are you with digital accessibility?</legend>
            <div>
                <input
                        type="radio"
                        name="familiarity"
                        id="unfamiliar"
                        value="unfamiliar"
                />
                <label for="unfamiliar">Unfamiliar</label>
            </div>
            <div>
                <input
                        type="radio"
                        name="familiarity"
                        id="modFamiliar"
                        value="modFamiliar"
                />
                <label for="modFamiliar">Moderately familiar</label>
            </div>
            <div>
                <input
                        type="radio"
                        name="familiarity"
                        id="veryFamiliar"
                        value="veryFamiliar"
                />
                <label for="veryFamiliar">Very familiar</label>
            </div>
        </fieldset>
    </form>
    <!-- Find source for this - can't remember where I saw it -->
    <!-- <li>
      Required fields in forms can cause keyboard traps, where the field
      will not allow the user to tab on without the required input. Mouse
      users can click away from the form, but keyboard users cannot.
    </li> -->
    <ul>
        <li>
            Keyboard traps, components which can have focus moved to them using
            the keyboard but cannot have focus moved away from them using the
            keyboard, must be avoided.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If the keys needed to move away from a component are more than unmodified arrow/tab
                    keys, the user should be advised of this.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Modals are a common cause of keyboard traps - ensure there is a way to
                    exit your modals that doesn't require the use of a mouse. The HTML <span
                        class="code">&lt;dialog&gt;</span> element should be
                    used for
                    modals whenever possible, as it handles keyboard-only use appropriately.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Modals should always have a semantic <span class="code">h1</span> heading (this may be styled to look
            smaller) and a body. The heading
            should indicate the content of the modal and/or reason for its existence.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <dialog id="accessibleModal">
        <form method="dialog">
            <div id="modalHeadingContainer">
                <h1 id="modalHeading">Interact with an accessible modal</h1>
                <button
                        id="accessibleModalCloseButton"
                        type="submit"

                if you hit Tab a lot?

            <div class="modalButtonBar">
                <button class="accessibleRectangularBlueButton" id="confirmButton" class="confirmButton">Confirm
                </button
                >
                <button id="cancelButton" class="cancelButton">Cancel</button>
            </div>
        </form>
    </dialog>
    <div class="buttonContainer">
        <button class="accessibleRectangularBlueButton" id="accessibleModalOpenButton">
            Open Modal
        </button>
    </div>

    <h4>Skip content blocks</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            It should be possible to skip past blocks of content that is repeated
            on every page (e.g. navigation, ad frames). This is often implemented
            as a "skip to content" link placed at the top of the page.
        </li>
        <li>
            These links can still be necessary even in smaller viewports - people
            using voice control or screenreaders on mobile devices, or those with
            high zoom levels on larger devices, still benefit from being able to
            skip repeated content.
        </li>
        <li>
            Entirely visually hiding these links for the sake of aesthetic
            prevents sighted keyboard users, those most likely to not have
            additional navigation methods, from knowing they exist and thus being
            able to use them.
        </li>
        <li>
            However, a permanent link doesn't always fit the planned user
            interface design. When it comes to "desktop" use, the best compromise between these conflicting needs
            is to have a skip to content link initially placed off-screen (not
            with <span class="code">display:none</span> as this hides the link from use entirely) which then
            is moved very obviously into view when it receives keyboard focus.
            This is done on every accessible page of this website other than the
            homepage for demonstration purposes.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Mouse or mobile use</h3>
    <h4>Consistent placement</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            It's important that elements don't jump around the page, particularly
            if this happens during use and is not in response to user action.
        </li>
        <li>
            A button moving out from underneath a finger tap or cursor, leading to
            a misclick/mistap, is incredibly frustrating for all users, but
            particularly those with tremors or who otherwise need to expend more
            effort on motor planning.
        </li>
    </ul>
