          In February 2024, only 4.1% of the top million web home pages were
          digitally accessible, based on automated accessibility checking.
        </p>
        <p class="bold">
          This checking only covers 25-30% of accessibility requirements.

      <div>
        <div class="h2Inaccessible">Introduction</div>
        <p>
          The
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/"
            >Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.2)</a
          >
          provide extensive and valuable guidance on the requirements to make
          the web accessible. There are three levels of compliance (A, AA, and
          AAA), with Level A being the absolute minimum required. This page aims
          to inform readers from a developer perspective of the basics needed to
          make their pages accessible to users with a wide range of disabilities
          and access requirements. Additionally, it is intended to help users understand a little of how it feels to
          have accessibility requirements that aren't met.</p>
        <p>Please see the Instructions section for activities to carry out. </p>
        <p>Below are some requirements that apply to
          multiple disabilities, or which do not fit into the categories above -
          more specific requirements are described in the pages for each
          disability.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="requirementsInfo" id="requirementsInfoInaccessible">
        <div class="h2Inaccessible">General Requirements</div>
        <div class="h3Inaccessible">
          Information and Relationships, Meaningful Sequence
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Use semantic elements - heading (<span class="code">&lt;h&gt;</span>) tags,
            <span class="code">nav</span>s for
            navigation, link (<span class="code">&lt;a&gt;</span>) and
            <span class="code">button</span> elements rather than <span class="code">divs</span> or <span
                  class="code">spans</span> with
            <span class="code">onClick()</span>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Never use the CSS <span class="code">content</span> property to provide meaningful text - this
            will not be included in the DOM and is thus inaccessible to anyone
            using tools that rely on the DOM.
          </li>
          <li>
            Content should have a logical order, and the focus order should
            follow the reading order.
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              For example, in a navigation bar, as above, tabbing through should
              focus on "Homepage", "Vision", "Hearing", "Dexterity", "FAQs" and "Instructions",
              in that order. Jumping around (e.g. starting with "Dexterity") can
              confuse users and make the page harder to use.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            Content should behave in the way it's shown - if something looks
            like a hyperlink it should change the page the user is on, not do
            something on the page like a button.
            <ul>
              <li>
                It's acceptable to remove link underlines in situations such as
                navbars, as long as it's made clear that they're interactive.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            It should be obvious to the user where they are in the website.
            Another example of this is the use of breadcrumb components for
            visibility of the sequence followed to navigate to a page,
            particularly useful in ecommerce with nested products and
            categories.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="h3Inaccessible">Enough time</div>
        <ul>
          <li>Many different disabilities can lead to users needing more time to complete tasks:
            <ul>
              <li>People with specific learning difficulties like dyslexia may take longer to read text.</li>
              <li>People with low vision may take longer to find information, or read it, whether due to assistive technology like a screenreader or working with a zoomed in view.</li>
              <li>People with physical disabilities may take longer to be able to physically interact with the page.</li>
              <li>People with disabilities impacting their processing speed, such as certain learning disabilities, neurodivergencies or "brain fog" from chronic conditions, can need more time to process the information.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Unnecessarily timed activities, such as the use of "toasts", can significantly negatively impact these users.</li>
          <li>Try interacting with the button below to get an idea of how this kind of timing might feel for someone affected.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="buttonContainer">
          <div class="inaccessibleRectangularBlueButton" id="inaccessibleToastOpenButton"
               onclick="openToast()">
            Open Toast
          </div>
        </div>
        <div id="inaccessibleToast">
          <p>IMPORTANT!!!</p>
          <p>This could be some really important information, such as warning a user that their basket is about to expire, telling them the action they just tried to perform couldn't be completed, or many other things.</p>
          <p>For many people, this toast is actively unhelpful because its presence is time-restricted and can't be extended.</p>
          <p>If something like a toast is needed, remove the time limit and make it dismissible using a button. Modals (using the <span class="code">dialog</span> element) can be an acceptable substitution for important information of this kind. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="h3Inaccessible">Seizures and physical reactions</div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Flashing lights can cause physical reactions in people with certain
            health issues, whether those are seizures, migraines, or another
            response.
          </li>
          <li>
            The minimum requirement to prevent these reactions is that nothing
            on the page should flash more than three times in one second, or the
            flash should be
            <a
              href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/three-flashes-or-below-threshold.html"
              >below general flash and red flash thresholds</a
            >. The latter of these can be quite complex to assess and may
            require the use of
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G15"
              >a tool</a
            >.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a video on the page breaches this, provide a seizure warning, as
            well as a
            <a href="low-vision-requirements.html"
              >text alternative to the video content</a
            >.
          </li>
          <li>
            This website does not showcase failure to meet this requirement due
            to the safety concerns that would cause.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Parsing
        <h5 id="coverUpH5">
          In content implemented with markup languages, elements:
        </h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Should have complete start and end tags.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Modern browsers have repair techniques, which allow them to
                parse broken HTML, but assistive technologies like screenreaders
                may not.
              </li>
              <li>
                An incomplete heading element's text may be accessed by a
                screenreader, but not be added to the list of headings.
              </li>
              <li>
                The "Parsing" heading above does not have a closing tag, so it
                may not appear as a heading to a screenreader.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Are nested according to their specifications. (The line starting "In content" above is actually an &lt;h5&gt; element, which means that the &lt;h4&gt; tier of headings has been skipped. This is bad practice.) </li>
          <li>Don't contain duplicate attributes.</li>
          <li>
            With the <span class="code">id</span> attribute have unique IDs..
            <ul>
              <li>
                Not using unique IDs means that screenreaders cannot accurately
                access any instance of an element with that ID other than the
                first.
              </li>
